# üìà Stock Dashboard with Machine Learning

This project provides an interactive dashboard for visualizing stock data and applying two machine learning models:

- A **prediction model** for forecasting closing prices
- A **classification model** for generating trading signals (`buy`, `hold`, `sell`)

Data is fetched from the Financial Modeling Prep API (FMP), and models are trained on the fly using TensorFlow.js.

## üß∞ Features

- Fetch daily or monthly price history
- Compute technical indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
- Predict future prices using a dense neural network
- Classify action labels (`buy`, `sell`, `hold`) based on price movement
- View model stats: MAPE, accuracy, label distribution
- Log model performance to `model_summary.csv`
- Fully interactive React frontend
- Node/Express backend using live FMP data
